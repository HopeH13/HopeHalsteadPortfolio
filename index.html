          <h3>About Me</h3>
           <p>I decided to enter the world of programming because my current career field is not fulfilling my passion or destiny in life. 
             After doing some critical thinking and processing what I wanted to do with the rest of my life,
             I knew I wanted to be involved in technology. That is when I decided I wanted to enter the field of Web Development.
             I want to be involved in the ever changing and evolving world of tech. I love the challenging aspect of programming. 
             I want to be a part of something that will make the world better and I believe that starts with 
            the technology we have at hand. And the technology that continues to evolve for the better. </p>
