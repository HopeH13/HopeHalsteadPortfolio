          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
  <p>  Experience with the process and practice of transforming raw data into a graphical interface by using a combination of HTML, CSS, 
      and JavaScript in such a way so that users can view and interact with the data. 
      With a focus on site design, layout, navigation, structure, fonts, colors, images, and content. 
<br>            
I am always looking to advance my knowledge with new frameworks, platforms and languages, ready and willing for the next challenge! </p>
<br>
          <h3>About Me</h3>
           <p>I decided to enter the world of programming because my current career field is not fulfilling my passion or destiny in life. 
             After doing some critical thinking and processing what I wanted to do with the rest of my life,
             I knew I wanted to be involved in technology. That is when I decided I wanted to enter the field of Web Development.
             I want to be involved in the ever changing and evolving world of tech. I love the challenging aspect of programming. 
             I want to be a part of something that will make the world better and I believe that starts with 
            the technology we have at hand. And the technology that continues to evolve for the better. </p>

     <p> I am ready to start my career in Web Development!  I love creating appealing and interactive websites that engage the user. 
            While following User Interface best practices, my main goal is to provide straightforward and functional websites that the users can identify with and 
            navigate without difficulty. I want to positively impact the community and company I work for in the most successful way.
